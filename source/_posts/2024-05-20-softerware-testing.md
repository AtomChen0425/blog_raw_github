#  Error,defect and failure

+ An **error** (mistake) is a **human action** that produces an incorrect result (for example writing code).
+ A **defect** (bug, fault) is an **imperfection or deficiency** in a work product where it does not meet its requirements or specifications (for example in the code itself).
+ A **failure** is when the system or component does not perform as it should (for example returns the wrong result)

TECHNICAL REVIEW is a formal review type by a team of technically qualified personnel that examines the suitability of a work product for its intended use and identifies discrepancy from specifications and standards.  
## Inspections
