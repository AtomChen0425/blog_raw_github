## Midterm review

1. Definition of **entrepreneurship**  
**Entrepreneurship** Is:  
The activities by which an individual takes a position between available resources and perceived opportunities and, because of some unique behavior, makes something positive happen  

![image](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/waterkingest/image_bed@master/20240221/image.5517dwh9q6g0.webp)

**Intrapreneur:** an employee who is tasked with developing an innovative idea or project within a company  
   + **EAO**

    1. **Achievement** in **business**, referring to the extent of your desire to achieve concrete results in business  
    2. **Innovation** in **business**, relating to how you perceive you might act upon business activities in new and unique ways  
    3. The **extent** of your desire for **personal control** over business outcomes  
    4. Your sense of **self-worth** or **self-esteem** relative to business affairs.  

**Entrepreneurship is not the same as management.**  
The principal job of professional managers is to make a business perform well. They take a given set of resources—such as money, employees, machines, and materials—and orchestrate and organize them into an efficient and effective production operation.  
Entrepreneurs’ principal job is to bring about purposeful change within an organizational context. They break new ground and, in many cases, each step is guided by some larger plan.  

1. **Innovation**    
   Innovation= Invention+ commercialization  

2. **Scalability** depends on **System**   
   not product or personality  
3. Entrepreneur model:    
   ![image](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/waterkingest/picx-images-hosting@master/20240222/image.3rayis04ej.webp)
   **T**echinician  
   **O**wner  
   **M**anager  
   **E**ntrepreneur
4. **Market Feasibility**  
    Market Feasibility - helps transform your concept from idea to market.
   + Determines the probability of success of your
   venture.
   + Provides a solid analysis and evaluation

    **A typical feasibility study considers the following areas:** 
    1. The concept for your venture 
    2. An assessment of your market 
    3. The technical feasibility of your idea 
    4. The supply situation 
    5. Cost–profit analysis 
    6. Your plans for future action
5. **Relationship between degree of innovation, risk, and profitability**   

| Innovation | Risk     | Potential Profit |
| ---------- | -------- | --------------- |
| New        | High     | High      |
| Moderate   | Moderate | Limited   |
| Copycat    | High     | Low       |

    ![image](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/waterkingest/picx-images-hosting@master/20240222/image.3uukgpkeci.webp)

11. Incremental innovation:  
    **Pros:**  
    **Low Risk:** Because it builds upon existing products, services, or processes. The company can leverage its existing knowledge and infrastructure.  
    **Stability:** Since the changes are gradual, incremental innovation can provide a sense of stability for both the organization and its employees.  
    **Customer Acceptance:** Customers may find it easier to adapt to incremental changes, as they are already familiar with the existing product or service. This can lead to higher customer acceptance and satisfaction.  
    **Cons:**  
    **Competitive Pressure:** In fast-paced industries, relying solely on incremental innovation may expose a company to competitive pressures from disruptors who pursue more radical approaches.
12. **Radical innovation**  
    **Pros:**  
    **Competition advantage:** Being a first mover in a new and transformative space can provide a significant competitive advantage. Radical innovators often set the industry standards and gain market leadership.  
    **Market Disruption:** Radical innovation has the potential to disrupt existing markets and create entirely new ones. It allows companies to beyond competitors and establish a unique competitive position.  
    **Cons:**
    **High Risk:**Radical innovation comes with high levels of risk. There's uncertainty regarding market acceptance, technological feasibility, and the potential for significant financial investments without guaranteed returns.  
    **Failure Rate:** Radical innovations have a higher failure rate compared to incremental innovations. The uncertainty involved means that not all radical ideas will translate into successful products, services, or processes. 

13. **Opportunity Cost**    
     Opportunity costs are not always easily observed,but should always be taken into account in production decisions.
14. **Sunk costs**  
    Sunk costs,past expenditures that cannot be recovered,are easily observed,but are never relevant in production decisions. 
    + Sunk costs are NOT included in opportunity costs.  
    + Example: Grocery store checkout line 
      + Time already spent waiting in a slow line should not influence your decision to switch to a different checkout line or stay put.
15. Economists use the word **marginal** to mean “extra” or “additional”
16. **Short Run and Long Run**  
    Economists refer to the **short run** as the period of time during which at least one of a firm’s inputs is fixed.  
    In the **long run**, the firm can vary all of its inputs, adopt new technology, and increase or decrease the size of its physical plant

17. Fixed Variable and Total Costs  
    Total cost = Fixed cost + Variable cost  
                TC = FC +VC
18. **Explicit and Implicit Costs**  
    **Explicit cost:** A cost that involves spending money  
    **Implicit cost:** A nonmonetary opportunity cost(opportunity costs)

19. AC VC TC

20. Long-Run Cost Curves  
    Economies of Scale  
    • AC falls with higher output  
    Diseconomies of Scale  
    • AC rises with higher output  
    No Economies of Scale  
    • AC remains the same  
    with higher output

    + **Preparation** refers to the background, experience, and prior knowledge the entrepreneur brings to the opportunity-recognition process.
    + **Incubation** refers to that part of the process where the individual contemplates an idea or a specific problem.
    + **Insight** may refer to what is commonly called the “eureka” or the “aha” moment. This is the moment of insight or conscious awareness that the idea may, in fact, represent an entrepreneurial opportunity.
    + **Evaluation** is when these insights are analyzed for their viability.
    + **Elaboration** involves moving the concept forward if it survives the evaluation stage.

    (price) (marginal cost)  
    Marginal revenue (MR) is the increase in total revenue resulting from a one-unit increase in output.   
+ There are many buyers and sellers,  
+ All firms sell identical products, and  
+ There are no barriers to new firms entering the market   
The first and second conditions imply that perfectly competitive firms are **price takers**: they are unable to affect the market price. This is because they are tiny relative to the market and sell exactly the same product as everyone else.

## technology and the success of the startup

## innovation: definition

Innovation= Invention+ commercialization

## innovation: incremental innovation v.s. radical innovation  
1. Incremental innovation:  
    **Pros:**  
    **Low Risk:** Because it builds upon existing products, services, or processes. The company can leverage its existing knowledge and infrastructure.  
    **Stability:** Since the changes are gradual, incremental innovation can provide a sense of stability for both the organization and its employees.  
    **Customer Acceptance:** Customers may find it easier to adapt to incremental changes, as they are already familiar with the existing product or service. This can lead to higher customer acceptance and satisfaction.  
    **Cons:**  
    **Competitive Pressure:** In fast-paced industries, relying solely on incremental innovation may expose a company to competitive pressures from disruptors who pursue more radical approaches.  
2. **Radical innovation**  
    **Pros:**  
    **Competition advantage:** Being a first mover in a new and transformative space can provide a significant competitive advantage. Radical innovators often set the industry standards and gain market leadership.  
    **Market Disruption:** Radical innovation has the potential to disrupt existing markets and create entirely new ones. It allows companies to beyond competitors and establish a unique competitive position.  
    **Cons:**
    **High Risk:**Radical innovation comes with high levels of risk. There's uncertainty regarding market acceptance, technological feasibility, and the potential for significant financial investments without guaranteed returns.  
    **Failure Rate:** Radical innovations have a higher failure rate compared to incremental innovations. The uncertainty involved means that not all radical ideas will translate into successful products, services, or processes. 

## innovation: S-Curve

![image](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/waterkingest/picx-images-hosting@master/20240222/image.3uukgpkeci.webp)

## extent of creativity, innovation, and critical thinking: compare market structure 
![image](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/waterkingest/picx-images-hosting@master/20240416/image.1sety40mwx.webp)  
## business and society: demand, supply, equilibrium

**Demand**: For a particular good or service, the quantities that the individuals and firms are willing and able to buy at any given price.  

**Supply**: For a particular good or service, the quantity that producers are willing and able to supply to the market at any given price.  

**Equilibrium**: 
1. **Equilibrium** in a market occurs when the price balances the plans of buyers and sellers. 
2. **Equilibrium Price** is the price at which quantity demanded equals quantity supplied. 
3. **Equilibrium Quantity** is the quantity bought and sold at the equilibrium price.  


## business and society: business decision making

IF THE MARGINAL BENEFIT EXCEEDS THE MARGINAL COST. DO IT.

## why creativity, innovation, and critical thinking: four categories of goods

![image](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/waterkingest/picx-images-hosting@master/20240622/image.13ln1donyq.webp)

## why creativity, innovation, and critical thinking: factors of production

1. **Labor:** all types of work, from the part-time labor of teenagers working at McDonald’s to the work of senior managers in large corporations. 
2. **Capital:** physical capital, such as computers, office buildings, and machine tools, used to produce other goods. 
3. **Natural resources**: land, water, oil, iron ore, and other raw materials (or “gifts of nature”) that are used in producing goods. 
4. An entrepreneur is someone who operates a business. **Entrepreneurial ability** is the ability to bring together the other factors of production to successfully produce and sell goods and services.

![image](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/waterkingest/picx-images-hosting@master/20240622/image.1sewlejagr.webp)  

## creativity: opportunity cost  
The highest-valued alternative that must be given up to engage in an activity  

Opportunity costs are not always easily observed,but should always be taken into account in production decisions.

## critical thinking: externalities  
But pollution is an example of an externality : a benefit or cost that affects someone who is not directly involved in the production or consumption of a good or service. • Think of an externality like a side-effect.

## creativity: production possibilities frontiers  

A production possibilities frontier (PPF) is a curve showing the maximum attainable combinations of two goods that can be produced with available resources and current 
technology.

## extent of creativity, innovation, and critical thinking: market structure – monopolistic competitive market
