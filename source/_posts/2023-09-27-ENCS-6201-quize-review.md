### Lesson 1

####  How has the concept of “professional” evolved over the years?

+ **Ancient**
Not comment, lawyers and doctor not organized as professions  

* Profession  
: Connected with the word profess  
* Professional   
: Person who professed his/her faith publicly  

+ **Medieval**  
  * Europe  
  : Professions in medieval Europe were differentiated into members of religious orders or those who were members of secular guilds 

+ **Modern**  
  Postindustrial society, is a society where the major source of **employment** has shifted away **from manufacturing-based** mass production in factories towards a service-oriented economy  

  Modern professionals share four main attributes. These attributes are:

+ Intellectual skills that are acquired through a formalized system of education or training
+ The exercise of judgment on matters connected with the practice of work
+ Membership in self-governing societies
+ Their practice of work contributes directly to advance public welfare 

####  What were guilds? What types of guilds existed in medieval times? What key responsibilities did they hold? What services did they offer their members?  
  * Secular Guilds 
    + Guilds  
    : 1. Guilds were exclusive organizations created to preserve **rights** and **privileges** of their members.
    : 2. These rights and privileges were provided by **kings**, **city hall**, or the **clergy**. Guilds could usually be categorized into two different types.  

      Two different type:  
      : 1. Merchant Guilds: Created to protect traders.
      : 2. Craft guilds: groups of **craftsmen** involved in the same occupation **bakers**, **cobblers**(补鞋匠), **carpenters**, **masons** etc  

    + Guilds in Medieval society  
        1. Operated in a feudal society  
        2. There was extremes inequality between **peasants** and **landloards**. 
        3. **Restriced** movement between levels
        4. Located in **cities** and so **separate** from **rural** exploitation  
        5. Provided a way of upward movement in status/ wealth
    + Guild Function  
  
      | Responsibility              | Services                                         |
      | :-------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
      | Restricted poor workmanship | Gave health insurance                            |
      | Forbade advertising         | Supported dependents of members in case of death |
      | Regulated Price             | Made donations to city                           |
      | Exerted monopoly control    | Served as councilors                             |
      | Limited number of masters   | Constructed public buildings                     |

    + Organization of Medieval Professions 
  ![image](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/waterkingest/image_bed@master/20230927/image.67gtkbgdle80.webp)  

    **Guild**: Associations of craftsman in a trade  
    **Craftsmen**: Owned businesses that produced goods or services   
    **Apprentice**: Worked for craftsmen to learn the craft   
    **Journeyman**: Worked witha daily wage

####  How does the post-industrial economy differ from the earlier manufacturing-based economy?

Postindustrial society, is a society where the major source of **employment** has shifted away **from manufacturing-based** mass production in factories towards a service-oriented economy  

A service-oriented economy is **driven by employment** in sectors that provide an array of services to society.
These services include things like **transportation** and **logistics**, **supply chain** and **retail**, **trade**, **finance**, **insurance**, **real estate**, and **professional business services**.  
Three categories: business entrepreneur, professional employee and service worker.
    
#### What are the differences between business entrepreneur, white-collar worker, and blue-collar worker?  
| Business Entrepreneur                                                   | White-Collar                     | Blue-Collar                                               |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| Owns a business enterprise                                              | Salaried with hight wages        | Sell their manual labour                                  |
| Generates  revenue from a stock of human, financial or physical capital | Administrative or technical work | Earn hourly wages for their labour limited or no benefits |
| /                                                                       | Risk of obsolescence             | Risk of technological obsolescence                        |

####  Elaborate on the four attributes of modern professionals discussed in the lesson: specialized skill, judgement, self-governance, advancing social welfare.

+ The attribute of skill
: Someone **spend exerl considerable effort** to acquire these skills which composed of varied and intellectually demanding techniques and practices.

+ The attribute of judgment:
: From some specital work, which is **not routine work** and **cannot be mechanized**, which means during the work, they need to make some choice **base on the training** they recive and experience they got during their worklife. These choices always have direct consequences for the public. 

+ Self-governance
: They have the **certification** from **self-governing professional** associations. These association **established by government** to govern the action of professionals to ensure that they **practice their profession to further public welfare**  

+ Advancing social welfare
: They will consider to **improve the welfare of the public**. For example, consider the effect that bad construction in a bridge could have on the general population that relies on the bridge to meet their transportation needs.  

#### Why is it impossible for individuals to become engineers simply by working as apprentices for years?

A key aspect of the nature of skill that professionals possess is that it is composed of **varied** and **intellectually** demanding techniques and practices, thus requires individuals to **exert considerable effort** in acquiring them. In order to acquire these skills individuals are required to undergo an extensive and formal education usually at the university level. This is so because many of the techniques **require a base of scientific**, **technological** or **mathematical** **education** that can **only** be gained from university based education.

#### What benefits arise from having professionals form self-regulating organisations
 They can ensure engineers practice their profession to further public welfare.

#### What main differences exist between the work and responsibilities of an independent professional and an employed professional?

+ Independent professions
  : work **independently** and **own paid directly** by the **client** for the service provided by the professional. They have much **greater autonomy**  

+ Employed professionals
: Hired by a **company** or organization. In return for a **monthly salary**. They have much **less autonom**y.

#### What is the purpose of professional licensing?   

 Government can **gover** the **behavior of engineers**. **Ensure** that professions are organized to be **accountable** to **society**. Professional associations composed of professionals practicing the same profession are a key aspect of the **linkage between professionals and society**.

#### Why can it be said that all professions are “moral enterprises”?  

Although professions are organized around technical practices and actions, the actions of individuals are **not just limited** to technical principles but involve **significant** **moral content**. In other words, the choices that professionals have to make in their work are **not just** about **technical aspects**, but **have moral** and **ethical** dimensionse. **Thus**, the objective of a professional system is to recognize the moral and ethical nature of professional work and create conditions, whereby member professionals will be guided to make ethical choices that work towards the benefit of society.  

#### What is the danger of mixing professional and personal values?  
 Mixing professional and personal values is a tricky thing, and should **require judgment on the part of the professional**. Some level of mixing is considered OK, but in other circumstances, mixing personal and professional values **would be considered a “conflict of interest”** and should be avoided. For example, wearing a **religious symbol** is not usually considered in appropriate display of personal values, but giving jobs to people of the same faith could be considered conflict of interest or discrimination, depending on the professional system.

### Lesson 2

####  What does it mean that professional associations in Canada are “statutory bodies”?

The work of professional associations is strengthened by **the power of a law passed** by the **respective provincial legislative assembly**. Each professional associations derives its power to c**ontrol individual professionals** from this statutory standing.

#### Why is the professional system for engineers in Quebec and the other provinces considered “closed”?

In order to practice most professions in Canada, an individual **has to become a member of the corresponding professional association.** A person, who practices the profession **without** an explicit license, is considered to be practicing the profession illegally and could **face legal** action. 

#### How can the professional system in Québec prior to the 1970s be characterized? Which challenges did this present in terms of accountability?
 Prior to 1970, the professional system in Québec could be **characterized** by the **existence of weak social contracts** . In other words, the professional system did **little** to be **explicitly** accountable to society . This **lack of direct accountability** was the product of **non-standardized professional associations** , whose mandates were not uniform across the province.
 
  Another fact was the acceptance of the **“liberal professional”** . A liberal professional operated with limited oversight  and was independent to conduct their professional practice . 
  
  A related aspect was the **absence of a strong,** **legally** binding code that governed the conduct of individual professionals. A combination of these three factors resulted in the weak social accountability of the professional system.


####  How is the professional system for engineers in Canadian provinces different from the system in the United States?  

![image](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/waterkingest/image_bed@master/20230928/image.263k307s2ha8.webp)

#### In what way does the professional model in Quebec emphasize member responsibilities, rather than rights?  

A **social contract model** for professional associations allow it to clearly define how professional associations contribute to improving public good. Such a model places more emphasis on member responsibilities rather than rights.

#### Within the professional system in Quebec, what is the role of

+ Government of Quebec?  
The government **reports to the National Assembly of Québec** on the operation of the professional system in the province.
The **minister presents legislations** and **resolutions** regarding the professional system in the National Assembly.  
+ Professional Tribunal?  
The professional tribunal is **composed of judges appointed** by the court of Québec. The tribunal hears appeals on** decisions made** by **disciplinary councils** of different orders.  
+ Office des Professions du Québec?  
Québec professional office advises the government of Québec on all matters **related** to the functioning of the **professional system**. It also ensures that **different orders respect** their **mission** to serve Québec society.  
+ Quebec Interprofessional Council?
Québec Interprofessional Council is **composed** of **representatives of all 46 different professional orders**. It is an advisory body that can be consulted on professional matters.  
+ Professional Orders? (25 with reserved titles and exclusive practice / 21 with reserved titles)  
One category of professions are those that have **reserved titles** and **exclusive fields** of practice.
There are **25 orders** that fall into this category, including the **OIQ**, or the order of engineers of Québec.
The other category of professions are those with **reserved titles**. There are **21 orders** that fall within this category, including the order of **professional technologists**

#### What is the role of the OIQ (Ordre des Ingenieurs du Quebec)? 

The OIQ is **one of the 46 professional orders** in Quebec that are recognized by the government to regulate themselves.
The important point to note is that **in order for any engineer** in Quebec to engage in professional activities, they **must** be a member of the OIQ  

#### What is the function of each of the following acts/legislation in regulating the engineering profession in Quebec?

+ The Professional Code  
  The **professional system** has its **legal basis** in The Professional Code.  
  The Professional Code provides the **legal basis** for the existence and operation of the Ordre des ingénieurs du Québec (OIQ), which is the professional order responsible for regulating the engineering profession in Quebec. It outlines the general principles of professional practice, including ethics, discipline, and the protection of the public interest.  
+ The Engineers Act (fields of practice, titles etc.)  
  is the **legal basis** for the **operation of the OIQ**.fields of practice is referred to as the field of practice of an engineer. The field of practice includes the kind of work that requires an engineer and the kinds of acts that counters engineering practice, **including consultation, measurement, design, drawing and inspection.**  
+ The Code of Ethics of Engineers  
  This code **outlines** the ethical principles and standards that engineers **must follow in their work**, including **obligations** related to public safety, confidentiality, conflicts of interest, and honesty. It s**erves as a guide** for ethical behavior and provides a basis for the OIQ to enforce disciplinary actions in cases of ethical violations by its members.  
+ Bill 101  
  While Bill 101 is not specific to the engineering profession, it may have implications for **language requirements** and **language use** in professional engineering practice in Quebec. It promotes the use of the **French language** in various aspects of public life, including professional communication, documentation, and education. Engineers in Quebec may **need to ensure compliance** with language requirements when conducting their professional activities.  

### Lesson 3
#### What is ethics?

It is **a branch of the discipline of philosophy**, is the **systematic analysis** of **behavioral choices** that humans or societies face. it is a way of analyzing and thinking about choices.  But ethics **differs from decision tools**, because it helps humans to **reflect on questions of right or wrong, of obligations and rights, or whether social and political goals are being met**. Now these kinds of decisions tend to be very subjective and dependent on the values or world view of the person making the decision. Ethics thus is closely related to values. Values are beliefs or worldviews that define individuals.

#### Why do we need ethics?

A simple answer is that ethics are **needed to help humans make choices**. It helps to have a **mechanism** that can guide how we think, reflect and then justify the choice we make.  Why do we need a mechanism to think about choices? This is because choices provide alternative courses of action that lead to different consequences and to different personalities that individuals have. if you are facing an important professional decision that can have important consequences on your career, the future of your company and your family life, you need a systematic method to help you think about the choice and then justify your decision. This is where ethics comes in. Ethics provides a means to rationally reason your choices.

There is another important reason for relying on ethics to make vital decisions because it allows us to avoid two pitfalls that many of us find ourselves in when making a decision.

#### What are the pitfalls of “absolutism” and “relativism,” and how can a structured and reflective approach to ethics avoid these?

**One pitfall** is the belief in **absolutism** that means the irrespective of **circumstances**, my decision never changes because my morals are absolute and **always true**. A good example of **absolutism** is when we make the decision to punish a person because they lied since it is always wrong to tell a lie, irrespective of whether the lie was told for self-interest or to protect someone else.

**A second pitfall** is the belief in **relativism** that suggests that one can never make a decision that is ok for everyone because all decisions are **subjective** and so **no one guideline is valid for everyone**. A good example of relativism is when you suggest that it is ok to hurt animals because in my community we believe it is an accepted thing to do. Ethical thinking and reasoning provides a way of thinking that can avoid these pitfalls.

#### What is the difference between morals and ethics?  

+ **Ethics**  
  
  Broadly **ethics** is an understanding of the philosophical basis for making moral choices. It allow indivual to make choices in an objective fashion. **But** objectivity of ethical analysis is always qualified by the relevant circumstance that influence the decision
+ **Morals**  
  It is **closely** related to **personal opinion**. Because it is not through a process of reflection but through a process of classification of right and wrong acts that are **dependent on cultural**.  
  It is from **place to place**, maybe some behavior is immoral in one region but will be moral in other region.  
+ `Conclusion`  
  1. **Ethics** are the systematic analysis of human behavior; **Morals** are customary norms of behavior.
  2. **Ethical** frameworks are not specific to cultural or geographic; **Morals** vary with time and geography.  

  **Morals**: Personal  
  **Ethics**: Impersonal

#### What are internal influences on practice of a professional morality?

![image](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/waterkingest/image_bed@master/20230929/image.6hx8yv2kfew0.webp)

Internal influences means Self governance, it comes from Ehtics, Values and Engineering Ethics.

+ **Ethics**  
  1. An understanding of the philosophical basis for making moral choice
  2. An object system of making choice
  3. Is qualified by circumstances

+ **Values**
  1. Beliefs that define individuals.
  2. Basis of world views and guide behaviour
  3. Govern the choices we make

+ **Engineering Ethics**
  Is the analysis of decisions, choices and policies that are morally desirable in engineering practice and research.
  The purpose of Engineering ethics is to develop some important qualities in practicing engineers.  
  1.  Moral awareness: the awareness of value conflicts that underlie choices.
  2.  Moral autonomy: the ability to think critically and independently about moral issues.
  3.  Moral imagination: the ability to discern alternative solutions to moral dilemmas.
  4.  Moral communication: the ability to communicate ethical issues in a precise and reasonable manner.


#### What are external influences on practice of professional morality?

External influence means Governance by an outside authority


+ **Law**    
  1. Established by competent authorities in a society
  2. Govern what is allowed required or forbidden
  3. based on customs and morals  


+ **Morals**  
  1. base on cultural religious or customer remorse
  2. can differ from place, community, region and country   


+ **Engineering Ethics**  
  Is the analysis of decisions, choices and policies that are morally desirable in engineering practice and research.  
  The purpose of Engineering ethics is to develop some important qualities in practicing engineers.     
  1.  Moral awareness: the awareness of value conflicts that underlie choices. 
  2.  Moral autonomy: the ability to think critically and independently about moral issues.
  3.  Moral imagination: the ability to discern alternative solutions to moral dilemmas.
  4.  Moral communication: the ability to communicate ethical issues in a precise and reasonable manner.  


#### How do internal and external influences work together to create “engineering ethics”?  

A good example of the code of ethics is the OIQ Code of Ethics for Engineers. The National Assembly of Québec required engineers to adopt a code that would establish the rules of conduct for professional practice.
The code of ethics is a mandatory regulation for engineers. **The code specifies that engineers have some required duties and obligations towards public, clients, including employers, profession of engineering.**
Failure of an engineer to comply with these duties and obligations could result in legal penalties.

#### Why can we say that an engineer’s approach to ethical problems is similar to engineering design thinking?  

The ethics problesm rarely have a **correct answer** that will be arrived at by everyone in the class. In engineering design, there is **no unique correct answe**r.

Both engineering ethics and engineering design apply **a large body of knowledge** to the solution of a problem, both **involve the use of analytical skills**. 

#### There are four recognized goals engineering ethics. Explain what is meant by each:  

1.  **Moral awareness**: the awareness of value conflicts that underlie choices.
2.  **Moral autonomy**: the ability to think critically and independently about moral issues.
3. **Moral imagination**: the ability to discern alternative solutions to moral dilemmas.
4.  **Moral communication**: the ability to communicate ethical issues in a precise and reasonable manner.

### Lesson 4
#### Ethical Reasoning

+ **Ethical Reasoning**
1. Reflecting on Choices   

In reflecting on choices, a key point to bear in mind is that ethics provides a means to justify in a rational manner, the actions we take in a professional (or personal) context. 

the ethical rule to “treat yourself the same way as others” is itself based on the general ethical theory called Deontological Theory. We will talk about Deontological Theory more in this same module, but this theory basically suggests that an action is only as valid as the means adopted to accomplish the action. If the means are not good, then the action that comes about is not ethically good.

2. Analyzing Choices

From this analysis, you should be able to present a clear reason to support the decision you make. It is this clear justification that demonstrates to your colleagues, your company, and your clients that you have thought through the decision very carefully and then arrived at the choice

3. Making the choice

 Any unethical actions could undermine your reputation and severely damage your career and your personal life. Thus, it is important to take professional decisions very seriously. Ethical reasoning provides a means to do just that.

#### Ethical Theories

Any human behavior has three aspects that include agent, action, and result.  

Agent focuses on the person who acts. The action focuses on the nature of the action, while the result focuses on the consequence of the action  
1. Agent

`Virtue Theory`  
Commonly referred to as Aristotle's Virtue Theory suggests that a better guide to ethical action is the character of the person performing it.  
The important question to ask oneself when facing a decision is what kind of a person will I become if I make this decision?  
Will I be virtuous or not in making the decision? Character and virtue of model persons are the immediate guides to decide what decision to make.   
Another aspect of virtue theory is that it suggests that virtue is best achieved through moderation by avoiding extreme choices, following the golden mean, and avoiding extremes of action is a way to make a virtuous decision

2. Action
`Deontological Theory`  
Deontological Theory focuses on the action itself in order to decide the ethical nature of an action.  
Actions are only **as ethical as** the nature of the action chosen. The **ends or consequences** do **not** justify the means chosen to accomplish them.  
**However good the consequences may be**, **if** the actions are **wrong**, they **do not** justify the action.  
A good example of Deontological Theory is **Immanuel Kant's Duty Ethics.**  

`Duty ethics.`   
Duty ethics argues that moral actions are those that are governed by following one's fundamental duties. In other words, those duties that are generated by one's conscience.   
**Immanuel Kant** suggested that we should **follow** this clear command of our **conscience** **only** if those actions **follow universal principles**  
There are some problems associated with the conscience focus of this theory. By focusing on the individual conscience this theory does not develop a notion of a good for society.    
So, while an action may be good for an individual's conscience, it may conflict with group interests.  
In such a situation duty theory does not provide any useful guides.

3. Result  
`Consequentialism`   
is the ethical theory that suggests that the ethical content of an action depends on the consequences produced by that action.     
If you want to decide on an action, you need to look at the hypothetical results that will arise from the choices faced in the action.  
An important problem is that all good or bad consequences of an action may not be immediately knowable at the time of making the decision.  
The choice is often made without knowing all the consequences of an action.  
Furthermore, there is the difficulty in characterizing what is good or bad in a situation. An example of consequentialist theory is **John Stuart Mill's Utilitarian Theory.**    
**Utilitarianism** defines an ethical choice as one that produces the maximum benefit for the greatest number of people.
The maximum benefit is understood here as the number of people affected.  
A near benefit is more important than a distant benefit. If a decision offers the maximum benefit, then that decision is the most ethical decision.
A good example of **utilitarian** thinking is **cost-benefit analysis**, where a decision is **made** by **weighing** the **costs** and **benefits** **associated** with the decision and choosing the decision that offers the **highest ratio** of **benefit** to cost.

### Lesson 5
#### Types of Professional Relationships

A professional relationship is defined as the relation between a professional and a client.

two models are prevalent, an ideal type model and an invisible client model.

##### Ideal Model

It is a model of professional relationship where the professional provides their skill and judgment directly to the client.

In this model, the client interacts with the professional alone, and therefore the need for professional’s ethics and competence is exceptionally high.

##### Invisible Client Model

This is another model of professional relationship that is common when professionals are employed to provide services within an organizational setting like a company

The professional does not usually interact directly with the client but has to follow the directions of the employer in order to satisfy the needs of the client

Some key aspects are that the professional is far less autonomous than the ideal type model because their actions are governed on a daily basis by the organization where they work.

#### Organizational Behaviour

Organizational behavior can be simply defined as the study of what people think, feel, and do, in and around organizations

Accordingly, organizational behavior can be differentiated into three kinds of influences, individual influences, group influences, and organizational level influences.

##### Individual Influences

Individual influences on a person's behavior in an organization can be differentiated into four: motivation, role perception, ability, and situational factors.

+ **Motivation**

Motivation could be defined as the force within a person that affects their direction, intensity, or persistence of voluntary behavior. Motivation drives behavior. It is the force behind an individual's decision to commit or not commit certain acts or behaviors。

+ **Role Perception**

Roles are positions that people occupy within organizations. These positions come with specific tasks, and associated duties and consequences for which we are accountable when we occupy these positions.
Roles help define the behaviors we should exhibit and those we should not when we do an assigned task.
Roles are important because they help us communicate responsibilities associated with a particular position and they set expectations for appropriate responses to or from others.

+ **Ability**

Ability refers to the natural aptitude and/or learned capabilities that individuals possess to accomplish assigned tasks.
Those with a natural ability to perform an assigned task often show a higher comfort level with regards to accomplishing tasks and this affects how they respond and behave with other co-workers.

+ **Situational Factors**

Situational factors are factors that can be either internal or external to the organization that affect how individuals function within the organization.
Internal factors could include time, budget, work facilities, etc. These factors influence how an individual does their work and so their behavior in the organization.
Similarly, external factors such as the current economic situation or consumer preferences affect the expectations from individuals and therefore, influences their behavioral responses.

##### Group Influences

Three aspects influence behavior while working in groups, leadership, power and influence, and team dynamics

+ **Leadership**

Leadership is the process of guiding and directing the behavior of people in the work environment.
It is important to distinguish between the leader and the manager. While a leader is an advocate for change and new approaches to problem solving, a manager is an advocate for stability and the status quo.
Leadership is of two kinds: formal and informal. Formal leadership is when the organization bestows the authority to a person to guide and direct a group.
Informal leadership is accorded unofficially when a person is granted the power to guide by others.

+ **Power and Influence**

Power is the ability to influence someone else's behavior, while influence is the process of affecting the thoughts and behavior of another person.
In an organization, power and influence is frequently exercised to get other people to do something that is in the interests of the organization or in the interests of a person.
Authority is the right granted by the organization to influence another person. Another common means of influencing other people is through politics.
Politics is especially useful in order to influence people who have authority over others.
Politics is the use of power and influence to further personal interest, some are acceptable, while others are not.

+ **Team Dynamics**

A team can be defined as a group of people with complimentary skills who are committed to a common mission, performance goals, and approach for which they hold themselves mutually accountable.
The structure of teams exert important influences on how individuals behave when working in them.
For example, structural aspects of teams such as goals and objectives, operational guidelines, assessment measures, and role distribution for team leaders and members, play an important role in influencing behavior.

##### Organizational Influences

Organizational level influences on behavior can happen through two aspects: organizational structure, and organizational culture.

+ **Organizational Structure**

Organizational structure could be defined as the division of labor and patterns of coordination, communication, workflow, and formal power, that direct organizational activities.
A common representation of organizational structure is the organizational chart that conveys in a visual diagram the relations between different roles people occupy in an organization.
Several factors differentiate the structure of an organization.
These include the span of control, which refers to the number of people who report to any person, the degree of centralization, decentralization, or the number of people with decision making authority in an organization, and the degree of formalization, or the standardization of rules and procedures in an organization.

+ **Types of Organizational Structure**

Differences in organizational structures reflect how structures are departmentalized.
In other words, it specifies how employees and their activities are grouped together.
It also establishes a chain for the flow of commands and for the coordination of information.
Organizational and management studies distinguish at least five major types of organizational structures.

1. Line Organization

The line organization is the most hierarchical structure. The only departments in the organization are those that accomplish the mission of the organization.
There are only direct vertical relationships among the different operations or line departments within a firm.
There is little horizontal communication across different departments.


2. Line & Staff Organization

This structure creates a parallel chain of line and staff. The staff provides advisory or support role to the line departments.
A good example is that accounting office that reports to the president, it also provides financial advice and support to the production and marketing departments.

3. Functional Organization

This organizational structure has a type of departmentalization that organizes employees around specific knowledge or resources.
Projects are divided into segments and assigned to relevant functional areas and/or groups within functional areas.
A disadvantage of this organizational structure is that employees develop a narrow understanding of business and this results in poor coordination across different functions.

4. Divisional Organization

In this type of organizational structure, employees are grouped according to the primary source of environmental uncertainty, depending upon whether the company is selling in multiple places, or to different clients, or if different products are sold across a country.
In other words, the structure is grouped around geographic areas, products, or clients.
The problem with this structure is that it results in the duplication of structure, personnel and resources.

5. Matrix Organization

A matrix organization tries to combine the qualities of a functional and divisional organizational structure.
In a matrix organization, employees are assigned to cross functional teams working on specific projects.
They also belong to permanent functional units from where they are distributed to projects.
This allows for optimum use of resources and expertise. A disadvantage of this structure is that employees are accountable to two managers and this can create ambiguity and conflict.

+ **Organizational Culture**

Organizational culture is a set of values and assumptions shared within an organization.
While values reflect the belief about what should be or should not be assumptions, our deeply held beliefs and mental models that guide behavior and tell members how to think about things.
Organizational culture is made visible through practices symbols and physical structures of the organization.
In other words, through actions that everyone in an organization does without thinking like for example, wishing the boss “Good Morning” our practices in symbols of organizational culture.
Similarly, physical structures like the nature of rooms, organization of office space, and decoration on the walls, all reveal the culture of an organization.

####  Influences on Professional Loyalty in an Organization

When professionals work within an organizational setting their behavior is influenced by individual, group, and organizational influences. Professional behavior is particularly susceptible to group and organizational influences. A powerful group influence on professional behavior is the nature of leadership and the style of leadership that is prevalent within the organization. Another important influence is the structure of the organization. Let us look at the influence of each of these forces on professional behavior.

##### Leadership Style

Leadership, as we have noted, is related to guiding and directing the behavior of people in the workplace. The objective of this guiding behavior is to deliberately shape the outcomes of how co-workers perform at tasks and duties with the intention of achieving organizational goals. Different leaders and managers possess different styles for managing their subordinates. Leadership styles can be of the following types.


1. Autocratic style – leaders adopt directive or controlling actions to enforce rules and activities. This style is particularly effective for tasks that need to be finished urgently. However, long-term reliance on this style can affect the judgment and autonomy of professionals.  
2. Democratic style – leaders take collaborative, responsive, and interactive actions with followers. This democratic style allows for the evolution of mutual respect between professionals and co-workers. There is far less pressure to be influenced by organizational priorities.   
3. Laissez-faire style – leader who fails to take responsibility of position. As a result, subordinates may have greater freedom, but there is little evolution of a coherent mission in the organization. In the short-term, professionals may face less pressures, but in the long-run will feel under-valued and frustrated.

##### Organizational Structure
Organizational structure of an organization also plays a vital role in shaping the behavior of professionals. This is because the nature of the structure shapes different facets of how individuals are managed, how communication flows in the organization, and how decisions are made. Some pressures that an organizational structure exerts on the individual professional are the following:

1. Success within an organization arises from not just professional success, but also from knowledge of how the organization is structured. The knowledge of how the organization is structured is crucial for a professional to understand how information and commands flow in an organization.
2. Another important aspect of organizational structure that influences a professional is the decision-making process. Who makes decisions, and how formalized decision-making is in the organization affects how professionals can contribute to decisions. 

### Lesson 6
#### Introduction to Professional Values and Relations

In this class we will consider four values that are key to developing an ethical professional relationship in your careers, especially in the Quebec context. These values are trust, loyalty, dignity, and honesty.

#### Trust
What is trust? It is a key value underlying a professional relationship. Trust is the ability to rely confidently on people, objects or circumstances. If we have trust in someone or something, we are more likely to rely on them while making a decision to do something.
For example, since we trust our computer to process our work and store it reliably, we have come to rely on them. This process of reliance however, introduces risk in a relationship of trust.

#### Why is Trust Important?

Why is trust important to a professional relationship? Trust is important for a professional relationship because in a legal sense without trust, there can be no professional relationship. In legal terms, a professional relationship is a fiduciary relationship and a professional is a fiduciary.
A fiduciary is a person in whom another has placed utmost trust and confidence to manage their property or money.
In personal lives, a good example of a fiduciary relationship is the relation between a parent and a child where the parent is a fiduciary. A fiduciary relationship, therefore, is one where the fiduciary has the obligation to act for the benefit of another. Violating trust violates the nature of the relationship.

#### Trust Building Obligations

Trust building obligations. For an engineer practicing in Quebec, the code of ethics for engineers directs engineers to create a bond of trust between the professional and the client or employer. A bond of trust suggests that the professional relationship between a professional engineer and the client or employer should be based on trust.

According to the code of ethics, it is a binding obligation for all engineers to create a bond of trust. In order to build the bond of trust, the engineer is expected to take several measures. These measures include disclosure of limits, integrity, and transparency, availability and diligence, independence and impartiality, confidentiality, and fees. While these measures are mandated for all engineers, they're more relevant for the independent engineer who practices alone, primarily because many of these measures are inculcated by organizational policies for engineers employed in an organization. Each of these aspects of trust building is described in detail below.

#### Disclosure of Limits

Disclosure of limits. Full disclosure to the client of the abilities and limitations of an engineer is a basic building block for trust by responsibly disclosing the ability of the engineer in terms of material resources, equipment, finances, space, or intellectual resources, people skills, or time resources. The engineer is sending a clear message to the client about their abilities, that the client does not overestimate the ability of the engineer to deliver. While disclosing resources it is important for the engineer to do so in a responsible fashion so that the engineer is not seen to be reckless, overestimates their abilities, or a naysayer, underestimates their abilities.

#### Integrity & Transparency

Integrity and transparency. An engineer must act in a fashion that demonstrates integrity and transparency in their professional work.

One means of demonstrating integrity and transparency is to inform the client at the beginning of the terms of agreement in writing. Subsequently, the engineer should ensure a document trail in all interactions between engineer and client. By documenting all interactions, the engineer sends a clear message that they are acting in a transparent fashion.

Integrity and transparency can be fostered by furnishing explanations as in when requested by the client. When these explanations are provided, it is important to ensure that contradictory explanations are not provided. Furthermore, when the client ignores the engineer's advice, the engineer must inform the client in writing of the consequences for ignoring their advice.

#### Availability & Diligence

Availability and diligence. The engineer must demonstrate reasonable availability and diligence in professional practice. A good way of demonstrating this is by making known the engineer's working hours and contacts and then ensuring the client can reach the engineer during these hours.

Similarly, the engineer must give advance notice if for some reason they wish to cease working for the client. The engineer can only cease to work for the client for some clearly defined grounds. These grounds are if the work involves illegal or fraudulent acts, if the client ignores the engineer's advice, and if there is a conflict of interest. We will describe what is meant by conflict of interest later.

#### Independence & Impartiality

Independence and impartiality. It is of utmost importance that the engineer ensure that their professional independence and impartiality is maintained at all costs. In order to do so, the engineer is required to take precautions to safeguard their independence and impartiality. One key fashion to do so is to avoid situations of conflict of interest. Another measure is to subordinate one's personal interest to the interest of the client.

Another means of ensuring impartiality is to ensure that the engineer does not receive fees for services provided from anyone else other than the client or the clients representative. These measures may seem minor but are important to ensure that the engineer is not just impartial and independent in actions, but is also perceived to be so.

#### Confidentiality

Confidentiality. It is of utmost importance that the engineer safeguard the confidentiality of the information provided by the client. In doing so, the engineer needs to remember that they are not authorized to share any of the client’s information unless explicitly released from secrecy by the client or requested to do so by a court of law.

In addition to not releasing the information engineer is expected to not use the client's information in a way that will prejudice the client or accept another mandate that will involve disclosing a previous client’s information.

#### Fees

Fees. An engineer is expected to charge fair and reasonable fees that correspond to the services rendered. The expectation is that neither will an engineer overcharge the client, nor will the engineer provide services for free. In fact, the engineer is forbidden from providing services for free. Accordingly, the client should be given a written explanation for the fees that were charged.

#### Conflict of Interest

Conflict of interest. As we had mentioned earlier, a professional relationship with a client or employer is considered a fiduciary relationship. Such a relationship creates a legal obligation for the professional to always act in the positive interests of the client.

One of the factors that can compromise the fiduciary nature of this relationship is conflict of interest. Conflict of interest can be defined as the existence of a parallel interest that could threaten or appear to threaten the exercise of good judgment of the typical professional.

A key point is that conflicts of interest affect the professional interest in judgment of a professional.

Another vital aspect of a conflict of interest is that perception is very important. As a professional, you may be confident that in a particular situation, you have not acted in conflict of interest, or that your judgment has not been compromised. But if popular perception is that a typical professional’s judgment could be affected in these circumstances, then you are in conflict of interest, irrespective of your convictions.

Conflicts of interest come in several types. The most common type is when professionals receive gifts, bribes or kickbacks in order to influence their decision.

Another type of conflict of interest is insider information for friends or relatives. For example, if you are hiring someone for the company and your brother has applied for the job, this situation exposes you to conflict of interest.

A third type of conflict of interest is the existence of interest in other companies. An example of this would be when you as a professional are working as a designer for one firm, while you have investment interests in a competing firm. As a professional, avoid putting yourself in conflict of interest situations. If it is unavoidable, a professional’s only safeguard is full disclosure of conflict of interest so that the conflict of interest stands revealed.

#### Loyalty

Loyalty. loyalty is usually described as an attitude or character that is demonstrated by a person through their actions. A clear demonstration of loyalty is when a person puts the interests of a person or institution, such as a family, community or nation before personal interests, even when such an action exposes the person to risk.

In thinking about loyalty in the professional sphere, it is important to distinguish between two kinds of loyalty, attitude loyalty and agency loyalty.

Attitude loyalty is loyalty that is considered an attitude or sentiment of a person. It is an emotional or identity response that arises from group affiliation. A display of attitude loyalty is considered a desirable quality, but usually not an obligation for members.

Another type of loyalty is agency loyalty that arises from fulfilling contractual duties. For example, if you are hired to perform a task in an organization, you are required to be a loyal agent as long as you work for the organization. Agency loyalty is a mandatory obligation that is fulfilled by obeying legitimate authority of colleagues and superiors and by following all policies and norms of the organization you work for.

#### Assessing the Moral Status of Loyalty

Assessing the moral status of loyalty. While loyalty is usually considered a positive sentiment in personal lives, the requirement of loyalty in professional lives needs careful evaluation. A sentimental consideration is unsuitable in the professional context. This is because an emotional form of loyalty requires unquestioned or absolute loyalty. Such an absolute response towards superiors or the organization would limit the possibility for an individual to develop an appropriate ethical response to forms of immoral action by the organization superiors or colleagues.

Instead, loyalty in the professional context requires use of judgment to develop and practice loyalty. It requires individuals to think carefully about what loyalty means and how much is owed in the professional context.

A good strategy is to critically evaluate the organization and how it treats employees in order to assess the nature of loyalty that is owed by an employee. It is important to think through questions like do I feel a sense of gratitude towards my employer? Is there a sense of fairness in the workplace? Is this organization responsive to the needs and concerns of its employees? Does this organization offer rewards and acknowledgments? Am I proud of this organization?

#### Dignity

Professional dignity. Dignity is a feeling of respect or esteem that an individual holds themselves in. Certain actions can cause damage to the positive sense of esteem about a person. Causing damage to the positive feeling of esteem of a person could cause grievous psychological harm to the individual.

In a similar fashion, professional dignity is considered a positive sense of esteem that the profession has collectively acquired as a result of positive contributions the profession makes to society. But this dignity or honorable reputation of the profession is fragile and can easily be compromised. Any member of the profession through their irresponsible actions can cause damage to the dignity of the profession.

In Quebec, it is a mandatory duty of each individual engineer to safeguard the dignity of the profession. This duty is prescribed in the province’s professional code and in the code of ethics for engineers.

#### Honesty

Honesty. Honesty is a moral virtue that is widely accepted, but not very well understood. Primarily because it is a practice relevant to many different facets of our existence in society.

In such a situation, since we could encounter honesty in so many spheres of our life, we do not often realize that we have been honest or dishonest in a particular aspect. In the personal sphere. Honesty can be interpreted as truth telling. So an honest person is one who can be relied on to tell the truth irrespective of circumstances. But in the professional context, honesty is not limited to just speaking the truth. It also implies representing oneself, our actions and our views openly and truthfully.

So in addition to honesty being an act of truth telling, it also means that to be honest in the workplace implies the act of following scientific facts, the act of avoiding inappropriate means and the act of showing respect to colleagues in a professional relationship.

The difference between honesty as truth telling and honesty as correct representation of actions can be distinguished by the difference between the act of commission and the act of omission. While telling a deliberate lie would be an act of commission on the part of the person speaking a lie. On the other hand, we lie by omission when we neglect to mention a relevant event, information or circumstance to a person. Thus, honest representation requires us to avoid both acts of commission and omission.

#### Duty to be Honest

Duty to be honest. Although not mentioned separately as a mandatory duty for engineers, the duty to be honest, has considerable overlap with the trust building obligations of engineers towards clients or employers and with their duty towards humanity.

But a few obligations indicate the duty to be honest. These are, the engineer shall express their opinion on matters dealing with engineering only if such opinion is based on sufficient knowledge and honest convictions. An engineer must be impartial in their relations between client and contractor suppliers, etc. An engineer must safeguard their independence at all times by avoiding situations of conflict of interest.

#### Whistleblowing

Whistleblowing. Whistleblowing is an act that follows directly from the requirement of engineers to be honest and transparent in their actions and views. It has been defined as an act by an employee of informing the public or higher management of unethical or illegal behavior by an employer or supervisor.

As an engineer, if you come to know of the commission of unethical or illegal actions in the workplace, your duty to be honest as an engineer demands that you approach either the supervisor or the public to reveal the existence of such actions. Not doing so would mean you have engaged in an act of omission.

Whistleblowing can be categorized into two types, internal or external, depending upon whether the whistle is blown inside or outside the organization.
Internal whistleblowing would mean going over the head of an immediate supervisor, who may be engaged in unethical action to a higher level of management.
External whistleblowing would mean going outside the company and report unethical or illegal actions to the media or to law enforcement agencies directly.
In the context of professional engineering in Quebec, there are well instituted procedures for whistleblowing. At the first level, when you encounter an illegal or unethical action in your workplace, your action should be to bring it to the attention of the company, first, verbally and then failing which clearly indicate in writing to the company the consequences that may result from ignoring your advice. If after this, there is no satisfactory resolution, as an engineer, your option, especially when certain works are a danger to public safety must be to notify the order. For an engineer in Quebec going public would imply approaching the OIQ rather than going to the media.

#### Trust Building and Conflict of Interest

##### Trust-building Obligations 
For an engineer practicing in Québec, the Code of Ethics for Engineers directs engineers to create a bond of trust between the professional and the client (or employer). A bond of trust suggests that the professional relationship between a professional engineer and the client or employer should be based on trust. According to the code of ethics, it is a binding obligation for all engineers to create a bond of trust. In order to build the bond of trust, the engineer is expected to take several measures.

One means of demonstrating integrity and transparency is to inform the client, at the beginning, of the terms of agreement in writing. Subsequently, the engineer should ensure a document trail in all interactions between engineer and client. By documenting all interactions, the engineer sends a clear message that they are acting in a transparent manner. Integrity and transparency can also be fostered by furnishing explanations as and when requested by the client. When these explanations are provided, it is important to ensure that contradictory explanations are not provided. Furthermore, when the client ignores the engineer’s advice, the engineer must inform the client in writing the nature of consequences for ignoring their advice.


##### Availability and Diligence

### Lesson 7
#### Professional Dignity
Dignity is a feeling of respect or esteem that an individual holds themselves in. Certain actions can cause damage to the positive sense of esteem about the person. Causing damage to the positive feeling of esteem of a person could cause grievous psychological harm to the individual. In a similar fashion, professional dignity is considered a positive sense of esteem that the profession has collectively acquired as result of the positive contributions the profession makes to society. But this dignity or honourable reputation of the profession is fragile and can easily be compromised. Any member of the profession, through their irresponsible actions can cause damage to the dignity of the profession. In Québec, it is a mandatory duty of each individual engineer to safeguard the dignity of the profession. This duty is prescribed in the province’s Professional Code and in the Code of Ethics for Engineers.

#### Relations with the Order of Engineers (Ordre des Ingenieurs)

Maintaining professional dignity requires the individual professional to demonstrate adequate respect for the Order, and for the role the Order plays in ensuring engineers are accountable to society. As a result, it is very important for the individual engineer to take his or her relations with the Order very seriously. These relations are scrutinized very strictly by the Order. One important requirement is for an engineer to comply with any request from the Order to participate in the self-governance of the profession. The engineer does not have a choice and must agree to contribute voluntarily to the Order. Similarly, the engineer must reply to any correspondence or letter from the Order as soon as possible. Delayed replies could form the basis for a disciplinary investigation. Another vital point is that individuals are forbidden to interfere, or otherwise, obstruct a professional inspection or investigation conducted by the Order. During such an inspection or investigation, an engineer is required to submit all their professional records (including their computers) for scrutiny. Not complying with such an order can result in a disciplinary investigation.

#### OIQ Controls Over its Members

The Order of Engineers Quebec (OIQ) exercises considerable control over its members to ensure that the association as a whole is meeting its legislative mandate of developing engineers, who remain accountable to society and who contribute positively to public welfare. In order to do so, OIQ exerts control on key aspects – membership, nature of practice, and social accountability. We will examine each of these aspects in detail.

 

**Membership**
For an engineer, to be a member of the OIQ is crucial to practice the profession. This is so because in Quebec a person can be designated an engineer in the workplace only if they are a registered member of OIQ. A member of OIQ is required to hold a permit issued by OIQ and their name be entered on OIQ’s roll. Thus, if for some reason they lose their membership, it is not possible for the person to continue practicing the engineering profession legally. Thus, it becomes vital for a member to constantly meet membership conditions. Important membership conditions are as follows:

Ensure registration on the roll every year on April 1st.
Not be temporarily or permanently stricken off the roll of OIQ.
Ensure that your permit is not revoked by the disciplinary council.
Meet important membership conditions for member renewal. These conditions include not having a criminal record outside the profession in Canada or in another country. Another condition is to have completely paid any disciplinary penalties or assessment during the year. 


It may also be required to meet physical/mental competencies to continue active professional life.

**Nature of Practice**
A major function of OIQ is to ensure continuous monitoring of the practice of engineers registered with it. OIQ employs different methods to monitor the professional practice. A vital and ongoing responsibility is exercised through the process of professional inspection. Professional inspection is conducted at OIQ by the Professional Inspection Committee. The primary mission of the inspection committee is to ensure that their membership meets minimum required standards for proper professional practice. In order to evaluate standards of professional practice, inspectors can examine any material aspect of practice, including records, books, registers, chemicals, products, substances, apparatus, and equipment entrusted to the professional by a client or employer. The Committee conducts general inspection according to a program published in the PLAN (the professional magazine published by the OIQ). In addition to the general inspection, the committee also conducts specialized inspection of a member, if it is explicitly asked to do so as part of an investigation. If during the inspection, the committee believes that the member is engaging in unethical practice, it cannot take disciplinary action but it can inform the Syndic if there are reasonable grounds that an offence has been committed.

Another major aspect of professional practice that is controlled by OIQ is discipline and penalty. All members of OIQ (including retired members or junior engineers) can have their professional practice investigated. Investigation is an internal process that aims to examine if unethical or offending practice was undertaken by a member. Once the process of investigation concludes that unethical practice was indeed conducted, the member is liable for disciplinary actions or penalties. In Québec, the OIQ has exclusive jurisdiction over any such investigations or disciplinary processes. In other words, these investigations or disciplinary processes cannot be challenged in a regular civil or criminal court. Investigations of malpractice are investigated by the Syndic. After concluding the investigation, the Syndic makes their recommendation to the OIQ’s disciplinary council. It is the disciplinary council that judges the complaint, hears the member and makes a decision to award penalties. According to the gravity of the offense committed by the engineer, the disciplinary council can recommend the following penalties – an oral reprimand; removing the member temporarily or permanently from the roll; a fine of $1,000-$12,500 with fines doubled for repeat offences; an obligation to remit a sum of money to the entitled person; or restriction or suspension to engage in professional activities.

 

**Social Accountability**
A key means of ensuring that members remain accountable to society is through the conciliation or arbitration process. The conciliation or arbitration process is a means adopted by OIQ to serve society. Any resident of Québec, who is unhappy over the fees they provided to an engineer and feels they were over-charged, can utilize OIQ’s arbitration process to determine if they were actually over-charged. This procedure applies only when the member is engaged in private practice and not employed by a company. As part of the arbitration process, the OIQ can examine the quality of service provided by the engineer to verify if the client was overcharged or not. If the investigation reveals that the engineer did over-charge the client for their services, OIQ’s council of arbitration will determine the amount of reimbursement the engineer has to pay to the client.

<!-- #### Test
A young and relatively inexperienced development engineer with XYZ Appliance,Joe has just been given the green light to develop an idea he had for a modular water purifier for the home. Not only had Tom Wang,Director of New Product Development, liked the idea,but he had asked Joe to form and head a project team to develop a prototype. Joe walks out of Tom Wang's office feeling "on top of the world." However,things don't go exactly to plan.

Joe sets to work.However.he soon discovers that he has underestimated costs.Unfortunately.the budget is fixed.
What do you suggest Joe should do?

A.Abandon the project
B.Select team members with less experience to keep labour costs down

Joe
Joe takes your advice.He chooses to work with less experienced team members.Unfortunately,because of the inexperience of the team.some design choices have to be changed.

He also realizes that the cost of the prototype (and the ultimate selling price of the appliance)will be higher than originally estimated.

Still,the day comes when the project team runs a series of successful tests on an operating prototype.

Joe sets up a review and demonstration with Tom,who then agrees to arrange a review with XYZ's Vice President of Marketing to ascertain Marketing's interest in the water purifier.

I wish you guys in development would ask for marketing input before you begin to work on a new  product.I can tell you right now that our department is not nterested in any type of water appliance!

Honestly.I think you've wasted company money.From my viewpoint,you can shut down the project and put your prototype 'on the shelf.'I'll get back to you if we ever develop interest in this area.but don't expect that to be soon!

Well.that didn't go well.Sorry about this.Joe.I guess our hands are tied.Just write up the final report.Unfortunately. we'll need to consign the prototype to the development "morgue".

Okay.Tom.This is too bad.We should have consulted with Marketing first!
I don't accept this!I am sure this device can be profitable.If we only had proof to share with Marketing!

Tom sighs deeply.

Joe is disheartened,but he decides not to give up.XYZ has a policy of permitting research and  evelopment employees to use 10 percent of their time to pursue new ideas without further authorisation.
So,Joe continues to work on the water purifier project during this time. Although he has every intention of confining his time on the project to 10 percent,he soon becomes so absorbed in the work that he spends
more and more time. 
He makes additional vendor contacts to get improved materials,"cons"a friend in Electronics Research to work on the control system,and has the machine shop do additional work on the prototype (charging shop time to another project of his). 
Through these efforts,Joe makes substantial improvements to the water purification appliance.

In your opinion,has Joe been loyal or disloyal to his company?

A.Loyal.Despite his less-than-upfront methods,he has produced a potentially marketable device!
B.Disloyal.Despite the positive result,he has abused trust and gone against company policy.

choose B
That's right.Joe has been disloyal to his company.Loyalty to the employer requires that employees follow company rules and the directives of supervisors unless those actions infringe upon the law or higher ethical principles-which is not the case here.

As well as ignoring policy,he has been dishonest in acquiring time and resources for the project.

Remind Joe which type of loyalty he should have demonstrated in this case?

A.Attitude loyalty
**B.Agency loyalty**
C.Brand loyalty

Joe is not a quitter.He believes that with some additional market data he can finally convince Tom to continue with the project and push for a marketing go-ahead. Joe had often discussed the
project with his wife.One day she gives him an idea about how to quickly gather market data.She had seen a food products exhibitor in a local shopping mall get passers-by to answer
questionnaires about the products displayed. Maybe he could gather market data on the water purifier in a similar way!

What do you think?Should Joe gather data at the shopping mall?

yes 

You are probably wrong.However.Joe is very pleased with your input.It is exactly what he had hoped to hear!

Joe arranges for members of his wife's garden club to demonstrate the water purifier for free at the local mall and to ask viewers to fill out a questionnaire determining their interest in the appliance and the price they would pay if it were for sale.

Joe is careful not to show any XYZ identification on the prototype,particularly because he has no  authorisation to remove it from the XYZ laboratory.Which dangers might you remind Joe of?

A: He could reveal confidential design information to competitors.This could harm his company economically.
B: He hasn't informed his supervisor about his plan to collect market data,which could undermine professional trust.
C: He has ignored company regulations by removing the prototype from the lab.He could face sanctions.
D : All of the above

Despite an amateurish approach,a considerable amount of data is collected.Reviewing the data.Joe is more convinced than ever that he has developed a marketable product and is eager to convince Tom of the potential.
He resolves to see Tom as soon as possible.

Now Tom faces a dilemma.Although he likes Joe,his response to Joe's actions could set a precedent for other employees in the organization.Which would be his best response when presented with Joe's market data?

A.Tom should simply overlook Joe's lack of transparency and failure to follow some company regulations.After all, Joe's initiative could increase company profits.
B.Tom should praise Joe a give him a job promotion for his extraordinary initiative.
C.While acknowledging Joe's efforts toward the product development,Tom should reprimand or impose a penalty on Joe for failing to show agency loyalty.

Correct.Despite Joe's initiative,Tom should reprimand or impose a penalty on Joe.Not doing so could encourage a culture of poor agency loyalty.

A recent graduate of Engineering Tech,Sophie has been employed in research and development at Larom Chemical for the past several months. Sophie was recommended to Larom as the top Engineering Tech graduate in chemical engineering. Alex Blunt,the head of Sophie's unit, showed immediate interest in her research on processes using a particular catalyst.(We will call it catalyst B.) However,until last week,Sophie's primary research assignments at Larom were in other areas,and she has only recently begun new research on catalyst B. Today,she received an e-mail message from Alex.It was copied to all members of the research and development unit.

To:Research and Development Team
From:Alex Blunt
Subject:Re:Decision on Catalyst for product X
Dear team members:
I would like to convene an immediate meeting with all engineers in the unit.
Within the next few days,our unit must recommend which catalyst Larom should use in processing  roduct X-a new product you all know is extremely important for the financial future of this company.
Since many members of the team have had experience with potential catalysts for the process,I anticipate a brief,decisive meeting.
Let's gather at 2 pm this Friday in our regular meeting room to decide.
Best,
Alex

Alex says:"So,team,which catalyst should we recommend for product X?"
other enginner1 says"We've been working on projects like this for years,and catalyst A seems the obvious choice."
enginner2 says "I concur.Catalyst A is the obvious choice."
Alex says:"Well,it looks like we should recommend catalyst A as the best choice.Do we have consensus?"

So far.Sophie has said nothing.She is unsure what further testing will show.but her testing over the past week provides some preliminary evidence that catalyst B may.in fact,be better for this process.
This finding is also in line with her own research at Engineering Tech,based on somewhat similar  processes.The process would require fewer metals,and the spent catalyst would be more easily recycled.
Although more costly initially.the process with catalyst B could lead to cost savings in the long run.Still,she hesitates because she feels she should defer to the experience of more senior engineers.
Should Sophie break group consensus by suggesting catalyst B may be a better option?

**yes**

That's right.By contributing based on her knowledge and honest convictions.she is acting with honesty and independence.In fact.remaining silent-an act of omission-could potentially harm the company in the long term.

At the same time,she will need to be very clear in presenting the limitations of her research on catalyst B.A hasty decision could also prove costly!

Which essential components of trust building should come into play in Sophie's decision to speak up about her research on catalyst B?

A.Disclosing limits,confidentiality,and availability and diligence
**B.Disclosing limits,integrity and transparency,and independence and impartiality**
C.Availability and diligence,confidentiality,and fees

Sophie syas "Catalyst A could work.However,my recent test results show that catalyst B might provide a number of environmental and cost advantages.But I still need to conduct further tests.Could the team wait another two weeks?"

Alex says "It would be nice to do more testing.but we don't have two weeks.We have two days!They're getting impatient on this one,and our unit needs to appear decisive!Besides.I doubt anything would show up in the next two weeks to change our minds.From experience,we know that catalyst A works. Let's wrap this 
up.then.Sophie.I need you to write a report.Leave out the preliminary data gathered about catalyst B."

Sophie says:"But,with due respect,even if the data on catalyst B is left out,the data on catalyst A is hardly conclusive."

Alex says:"Look.you're bright.You can make the numbers look good without difficulty.Do the math backwards if you have to! Let's recommend catalyst A."

Alex is Sophie's team leader.Would she show a lack of "agency loyalty"-in other words,professional loyalty to her employer-by not complying with wishes of her direct supervisor?

**No**

That's right.While it is true that agency loyalty requires following company rules along with the directives of supervisors,this must not be done uncritically

In this case,the team leader is suggesting an unethical action-misrepresentation of research data in the interest of expediency.A critical approach to agency loyalty would require greater honesty.integrity.and transparency.

A.Follow Alex's suggestion to "do the math backwards"to show that catalyst A is the better option.
B.State that the data on catalyst A is hardly conclusive but not mention data on catalyst B.
**C.Include the current data of catalyst A but state also that further research should be conducted on both catalysts A and B before choosing the final option.**

That's right.Professional values of honesty,integrity,and transparency suggest this is the best approach.

After completing the initial report. Sophie has an opportunity to do more research on catalyst B.After several weeks,her research decisively indicates that catalyst B would have been the better choice. Still,she feels apprehensive going against the initial recommendations of more senior engineers on the team.She also fears repercussions on her career if she counters the wishes of her immediate supervisor.

what should Sophie do
A.She should keep the data for herself and only disclose findings to Alex by request.
B.She should disclose the new data and results immediately to Alex.
C.She should send the data to another lab for further investigation and validation of the results.
**D.She should write and submit another report presenting the new data and results.**
That's right.Documenting the results of her research in a second report is the most transparent option because it leaves a document trail.

Even if,based on the recommendations of more senior engineers,the company chooses to go with catalyst A-the more costly and less environmentally friendly option-Sophie will still have acted with  honesty.integrity,and transparency. -->

### lesson 8
#### Duty towards the Public
This is a key duty for engineers who wish to practice the profession in Québec. Here the term public is understood very broadly. When we use the term public, we usually mean citizens. The meaning of public refers to the duty of engineers to the citizens of Québec/Canada. But it also uses public in another sense to mean the opposite of private. In that sense, public means the common good of people in Québec. Engineers have a duty to safeguard the common public good in Québec. This duty to safeguard the common public good is enforced through two duties – the first to humanity and the second to protect life and environment.

##### **Duty to Humanity**
The Code of Ethics for engineers specifies that fundamentally “In all aspects of their work an engineer must respect their obligations towards humanity.” This duty specifies that, first and foremost, engineers exist to protect and respect humans. While this obligation towards humans arises from many civil and criminal laws, fundamentally it is governed by key legal frameworks in Canadian and Québec law – the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Québec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms. The Canadian charter guarantees certain fundamental freedoms to humans living in the country. These freedoms include fundamental freedoms, such as freedom of conscience, religion, belief, expression, and association. In addition, the charter gives rights, such as democratic rights, mobility right, legal rights, equality rights, and language rights. In other words, in their work, professionals have a duty to not violate the provisions of the Canadian charter and the Québec charter. One major implication of this duty is to ensure that engineers do not engage in discrimination of any form. Discrimination is a violation of the Canadian charter, especially the equality rights specified in it. In turn, this means that no professional may refuse to provide services to a person because of their race, colour, age, sex, religion, national origin or ethnicity of such person.

##### **Duties towards Life and Environment **        
The Code of Ethics also specifies that “In all aspects of their work, the engineer must take into account the consequences of the performance of his work on the environment and on the life, health and property of every person.” There are two aspects to this duty. The first is to act in a manner to safeguard the environment, and the second is to be mindful of the life, health, and property of every human. Safeguarding the environment requires the engineer to be mindful of technological choices that do not promote the pollution and eventual destruction of the environment and will further sustainable development. The respect for life, health and property relates closely to the rights mentioned in the Canadian charter.

#### **Ethical Constructs**

##### **Prejudice**

An opinion formed without taking time and care to judge fairly, often based on incomplete and stereotyped in formation.


##### **Discrimination**

Treating people differently because of some particular social sttribute such as race, gender or religion. 
**Adverse effect discrimination**

Discrimination that happens as a result of applying a rule or policy uniformaly.

![image](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/waterkingest/image_bed@master/20231115/image.7187hpbl51o0.webp)

##### **Harassment**
This is a particular type of discrimination. It occurs when a person is subjected to unwanted behaviour that offends, demeans or humiliates.
1. Sexual
2. Racial
3. Ridicule


#### **Thinking About Inclusivity and Diversity**

We have seen that professionals have a duty to not violate the provisions of the Canadian charter and the Québec charter. One major implication of this duty is to ensure that engineers do not engage in discrimination of any form. But what is meant by discrimination, and how does it relate to priorities in Canadian society? We will examine these aspects in detail.  

 

**Prejudice, Discrimination, and Harassment**

In thinking about discrimination, it is useful to understand the concept in the context of two related concepts of prejudice and harassment. The Association of Professional Engineers, Geophysicists, and Geologists of Alberta (APEGGA) defines prejudice as an opinion formed without taking time and care to judge fairly, often based on incomplete and stereotyped information. The key point is that prejudice is a biased opinion that is often based on incomplete information. Discrimination is usually built on prejudiced opinions, but it takes prejudice a step further because it influences behaviours. Discrimination implies treating people differently because of some particular social attribute, such as race, gender or religion. Discrimination, when it results in an extreme form of behavior, results in harassment. It occurs when an individual is subjected to unwanted behaviour that offends, demeans, or humiliates.

Discrimination comes in several forms, some of them are directed while others are less easy to identify. Direct discrimination is discrimination that is directed against person(s) on the basis of prejudice. This is the most clearly identifiable form of discrimination, primarily because it happens in the open so that people become aware of it. Another form of discrimination is adverse effect discrimination. It is a discrimination that happens as a result of applying a rule or policy uniformly. When governments or companies apply a policy in society, it often discriminates against groups in society as a result. A good example is positive discrimination in hiring that favours visible minorities or women. There is an adverse effect discrimination that is created against those who do not fall within these groups. Their chances at getting the same jobs have been reduced because of the preference that underrepresented groups have. A final form of discrimination is systemic discrimination. This discrimination is widespread but not very easy to identify. It is a discrimination that is rooted in accepted ways of doing things in a business, profession, or occupation. This tends to prevent categories of people from achieving their goals. A good example of this is the glass ceiling. The glass ceiling is the existence of a barrier that prevent women from advancing in their careers in that organization beyond a particular level.

 

**Multiculturalism and Diversity**

Multiculturalism and diversity are the opposite of discrimination. Diversity is the variety in different social categories, such as gender, race, ethnicity, age, religion, national origin or sexual orientation. Multiculturalism is an equal acceptance for social differences in terms of gender, age, sexual orientation, ethnicity, race or national origin. While diversity is the presence of cultural differences in society, multiculturalism is a positive accepting attitude towards these differences. Such a multicultural orientation that fosters diversity has several advantages. It fosters a spirit of mutual understanding in the workplace, and more importantly, it allows everyone to develop their abilities to its full potential. In Canada, multiculturalism is an official policy that reflects an equal acceptance of races, religions, languages and cultures. This policy is furthered through Canadian legislation. The preservation and enhancement of multicultural heritage in Canada is the aim of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. In addition, Canada’s Multiculturalism Act of 1988 protects aboriginal rights, and the rights of people to enjoy their cultures and use of languages other than English and French. This legal background has allowed a mix of ethnic groups, languages, and cultures to co-exist in Canada. It is for these reasons that Canada is considered a cultural mosaic unlike U.S., which has adopted a melting pot approach. Canada, unlike U.S., seeks to foster diversity without assimilating different cultural groups.   

#### Honesty

Honesty is a moral virtue that is widely accepted but not very well understood, primarily because it is a practice relevant to many different facets of our existence in society. In such a situation, since we could encounter honesty in so many spheres of our life, we do not often realize that we have been honest or dishonest in a particular aspect. In the personal sphere, honesty can be interpreted as truth-telling. So an honest person is one who can be relied on to tell the truth irrespective of circumstances. But in the professional context, honesty is not limited to just speaking the truth. It also implies representing oneself, our actions, and our views openly and truthfully. So in addition to honesty being the act of truth telling, it also means that to be honest in the workplace implies the act of following scientific facts, the act of avoiding inappropriate means, and the act of showing respect to colleagues in a professional relationship. The difference between honesty as truth-telling and honesty as correct representation of actions can be distinguished by the difference between an act of commission and an act of omission. While telling a deliberate lie would be an act of commission on the part of the person speaking a lie; on the other hand, we lie by omission when we neglect to mention a relevant event, information, or circumstance to a person. Thus, honest representation requires us to avoid both acts of commission and omission.               

**Duty to be Honest**
Although not mentioned separately as a mandatory duty for engineers, the duty to be honest has considerable overlap with the trust-building obligations of engineers towards clients or employers and with their duty towards humanity. But a few obligations indicate the duty to be honest. These are:

* The engineer shall express their opinion on matters dealing with engineering, only if such opinion is based on sufficient knowledge and honest convictions.
* An engineer must be impartial in their relations between the client and the contractors, suppliers, etc.
* An engineer must safeguard their independence at all times to avoid situations of conflict of interest. 
**Whistleblowing**    
Whistleblowing is an act that follows directly from the requirement of engineers to be honest and transparent in their actions and views. It has been defined as an act by an employee of informing the public or higher management of unethical or illegal behavior by an employer or supervisor. As an engineer, if you come to know of the commission of unethical or illegal actions in the workplace, your duty to be honest as an engineer demands that you approach either the supervisor or the public to reveal the existence of such actions. Not doing so would mean you have engaged in an act of omission. Whistleblowing can be categorized into two types – internal or external, depending upon whether the whistle is blown inside or outside the organization. Internal whistleblowing would mean going over the head of an immediate supervisor (who maybe engaged in unethical action) to a higher level of management. External whistleblowing would mean going outside the company and report unethical or illegal actions to the media or to law-enforcement agencies directly.

In the context of professional engineering in Québec, there are well instituted procedures for whistleblowing. At a first level, when you encounter an illegal or unethical action in your workplace, your action should be to bring it to the attention of the company, first verbally, and then failing which clearly indicate in writing to the company, the consequences that may result from ignoring your advice. If after this, there is no satisfactory resolution, as an engineer, your option, especially when certain works are a danger to public safety, must be to notify the Order. For an engineer in Québec, going public would imply approaching the OIQ rather than going to the media.

#### Test

Assume you are a professional engineer working for the Canadian branch of a large high-precision    manufacturing company with a head office in Antarctica.
A huge international technical conference is tobe held in your city,including technical seminars and a tradeshow.Your company wants to present its products and services at the trade show.
You are in charge of planning,designing,and staffing several product displays.

On the first day of the trade show,you have everything ready displays,booths,and literature and you have arranged with an employment agency to hire a temporary receptionist. The receptionist arrives early,and she appears suitable for the job.

However,before you can explain her duties,your boss calls you aside, observes that the receptionist is a woman and states

He explains that women are very rare in the workplace in the country where the head office is located.And when the chief executives arrive, they definitely will not expect a woman receptionist to welcome them and other visitors to the company display.So your boss instructs you What should you do?

### lesson 9
####  Law and Legal Systems


**Law**
Law, as we have described earlier, is a rule that regulates what is accepted or forbidden in a society. Laws are created by a competent authority, such as a parliament or a legislative assembly. Laws are enforced through a system composed of enforcement agencies (example: the police) and the judiciary. The body of law that governs a society can be subdivided, according to its focus, into two broad domains – public law and private law. Public laws are those laws that govern the actions of the state (or government) or the relations of the state and individuals. Examples of public law are international law, constitutional law, administrative law, or criminal law. Private law, on the other hand, is solely concerned with regulating the relations and disputes between private individuals. Examples of private law include commercial law, family law, property law, etc.                  

 

**Legal Systems**
Legal systems are related to laws, but as the name implies, it is the system that has built up around the process of implementing laws in a society. Legal systems could be defined as existing system for interpreting and enforcing laws. A legal system becomes the basis for:

+ The sources of laws and regulations that govern a society
+ The practices and customs followed by courts in interpreting laws to make decisions regarding legal disputes
+ And as frameworks that govern interpretation of statutes, legislation and bylaws
Different countries around the world have different legal systems. In this module, you will find a map of the world indicating the major legal systems and their combinations, which are prevalent in different countries. Click on the major legal systems to understand their key features. In this class, we are concerned with two major legal systems – civil law and English common law systems. There are some key features that distinguish these two major legal systems. First, in a civil law system, laws are written into systematic collections referred to as codes. Second, Laws are created by legislatures alone. Third, legal decisions made by judges are based solely on applying the laws to the case. Finally, justice is produced through an inquisitorial process led by the judge. English common law, on the other hand, is based on laws and earlier cases that are similar. Second, laws are created both by legislatures and judges on the basis of the precedence value of earlier cases and judgments. Third, legal decisions are based not only on laws but also on precedence value of previous judgments. Finally, justice is produced through an adversarial process between two opposing sets of advocates with the judge acting as a neutral umpire.

 

**Québec’s Legal System**        
Québec’s legal system is unique in Canada, because it has a mixed legal system. While other provinces in Canada follow the English common law system, Québec, given its French history, follows a mixed legal system that has elements of English common law and French civil law. In Québec, all criminal matters are decided through English common law, while property and civil matters for disputes between private citizens are based on the Québec Civil Code. Québec Civil Code is derived from French civil law, and therefore, legislation is the primary source of law and courts are not dependent on taking into account the precedence value of previous judgments. Laws in the Québec Civil Code have been arranged systematically to form a code comprising ten books. Each book deals with a body of law, such as persons, family, successions, property, etc.

#### Intellectual Property in Canada

In our modern innovation-driven economy, ideas (especially new ideas) are valuable commodities that often form the basis for lucrative commercial ventures. If we look around, we can quickly see how some ideas have become the basis for popular devices, objects, technologies, or programs. In such a situation, these ideas are indeed very valuable and require legal protection so that those who developed these ideas can derive benefit from them. In law, novel ideas are considered intellectual property and, if it meets certain conditions, can acquire the same kinds of protection that other pieces of property like land, money, or houses have. Canada recognizes five major types of intellectual property – patents, copyright, trademark, industrial design protection and Integrated Circuit Topographies (ICT) protection. All types of intellectual property are protected through dedicated federal laws. Intellectual property is administered in Canada through the Canadian Intellectual Property Office. You can visit their website http://www.cipo.ic.gc.ca for more information regarding intellectual property administration in Canada. We will now describe each major kind of intellectual property in detail.          

 

**Patents**
A Patent is a government grant that gives inventors exclusive rights to their inventions. It gives the inventor an exclusive right to make, sell, and use the invention. In order to receive a patent, the invention must meet the following criteria – it must be new; must show utility (or in other words, must be working model that is functional and operative, it is not enough to have a concept); and must show inventive ingenuity not obvious to someone with the same skills. A patent can be given for a product, a chemical composition or process, but it cannot be granted for a principle, theorem, idea, or computer program. The term of the protection for any new patent is 20 years from the date the application was filed.        

 

**Copyright**    
A copyright protects the expression of information in literary, musical, dramatic, or artistic works. The work must be published, recorded, performed, or communicated in order for the copyright protection to apply. Copyright provides the author the exclusive right to allow someone to copy a creative work. The following are not eligible for copyright protection ‒ facts, themes, ideas, most titles, names, catch-phrases, and other short-word combinations. Copyright is owned by the creator, employer, or one who commissioned it. One aspect that makes copyright unique is that it does not require registration. All it requires that the author place the copyright symbol © followed by the author’s name and year in the work to gain copyright protection. In Canada, the duration of copyright protection exists for the life of the creator plus 50 years following death.   

 

**Trademark**
A trademark protects marks used to distinguish goods or services of one organization from those of others. It is usually provided for catch-phrases, short-word combinations, symbols or designs, or a combination of these. A registered trademark allows the owner to use the trademark in association with specific goods or services. The term of protection is 15 years, but it can be renewed indefinitely as long as it is in continuous use. There are three types of trademarks:

+ Ordinary marks are words and/or symbols that distinguish the goods or services of a specific firm (e.g., Dell or MacBook).
+ Certification marks identify goods or services that meet a standard set by a governing organization (e.g., Energy Star or LEED certification).
+ Distinguishing guise identifies the shaping of wares or their containers, or a mode of wrapping or packaging wares (e.g., iPad).

**Industrial Design Protection**

Industrial design protection protects the shape, configuration, and pattern or ornament (or any combination of these) applied to a finished, mass-produced item. Examples of items protected include furniture, toys, household items, and vehicles. The protection may apply to, for example, the shape of a table, or the ornamentation on the handle of a spoon. What cannot be protected are: the functional features of an article; a principle of construction, or how an article is built; the materials used in the construction of an article (for example, glass); colour; or ideas. The period of protection is 10 years.

 

**Integrated Circuit Topographies (ICT) Protection**
An integrated circuit topography refers to the three-dimensional configuration of electronic circuits used in microchips and semiconductor chips. ICT protection will give you exclusive rights over the copying of the topography and the commercialization of circuits that are contained in the topography. Registration grants you exclusive rights for 10 years on your original circuit design.

#### Occupational Health and Safety in Canada
Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) legislation provides a framework to regulate and minimize exposure of workers to hazardous or dangerous working conditions and workplaces. In Canada, the jurisdiction of legislation is shared between federal and provincial or territorial governments. However, in practice, over 90% of Canadian workers are governed under provincial legislation. It is only the remaining 10% of the workers working in federal installations and workplaces, such as airports that are governed by federal OHS legislation. Despite the major provincial role for governing OHS legislation, the federal government has established the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety as a clearinghouse and advocacy group to advance safe and healthy workplaces in the country.          

 

**Key Features**
OHS legislations in Canada have some key features that are common to most such legislations. One key feature is that employees, under OHS legislation, are granted certain rights. An important right is the ability to refuse to do unsafe work. In other words, workers can refuse to do work that they think is unsafe or dangerous. Workers also have the right to be informed about actual and potential dangers.  Another right is to participate in workplace health and safety activities through Joint Health and Safety Committee (JHSC) as a worker health and safety representative. In addition to worker rights, supervisors, or employers have important responsibilities to ensure workplace safety. Key aspects of supervisor responsibility are:

+ To ensure that workers use prescribed protective equipment devices
+ To advise workers of potential and actual hazards
+ To take every reasonable precaution in the circumstance for the protection of workers

The legislation usually also prescribes responsibility for workers but these, unlike supervisors’, do not carry a legal burden. Worker responsibilities include:

+ To work in compliance with OHS acts and regulations
+ To use personal protective equipment and clothing as directed
+ To report hazards and dangers.
Another important aspect of OHS legislation is the concept of due diligence. Despite, their best efforts, if there is an accident in the workplace, supervisors can use due diligence as a defence, if they are charged with violating OHS guidelines. Due diligence is a legal defence that suggests that all reasonable precautions, under the particular circumstances, were taken. If charged under OHS laws, a defendant may be found not guilty, if he or she can prove that due diligence was exercised in protecting the workplace.

 

**Québec OHS Legislation**        
Québec OHS legislation called the Act Respecting Occupational Health and Safety (Québec) was introduced in 1979. It is a progressive legislation that has all the major features of OHS legislation in Canada. It provides workers with the right to refuse unsafe work and participate in Health and Safety Committees. In addition, it places the burden of responsibility on employers or supervisors to ensure safe workplaces. Another feature of Québec’s OHS legislation is that it distinguishes workplaces into “ordinary” workplaces, where workers are not exposed to very dangerous environments, and to “special” workplaces, that have elevated risks of injury. Depending on the nature of the workplace, different measures are needed.    

 
### Lesson 10
#### Responsibility and the Evolution of Liability

**Responsibility**

Responsibility can be defined as responding to or answering for an action performed. All actions that we take have consequences either for ourselves or for other people who surround us. Now it may not always be possible to foresee the kind of consequences that may arise from our actions, but in most situations it is possible to know the consequences of an individual’s actions. Answering or accounting for the consequences of ones actions is what is implied by responsibility. In order for a person to be held morally responsible for an action, we should be able to determine two aspects. First, we need to verify agency of the action, in other words who did the action. Second, we need to know the degree of wilful intent or in other words, the nature of circumstances that guided the action. In some situations, the responsibility for the action might be less because of the nature of circumstances. Fixing these two aspects allows us to fix the moral responsibility of an action.

A key aspect associated with thinking about responsibility is the concept of role. A role (especially a social role) is a position that an individual holds. A few such common roles are parent, student, professor, engineer, doctor, etc. Individuals often fills multiple roles in society. One could be an engineer who is also a parent. The idea of role is crucial to understand responsibility. Because if a person fills a role in society, then society has expectations about how that person should act in that role. Individuals are held responsible when they do not meet the expectations of the role they fill in society. So if you are an engineer, there is an expectation that you will act responsibly when producing products for society. If you do not meet that expectation, you will be held responsible for it.

 

**Evolution of Liability**

When talking about responsibility in the legal context, we encounter the term liability. Liability can be defined as the responsibility that is backed by the power of the law. In other words, if you do not meet the expected responsibility in your professional work, you could be held liable or legally responsible by the consumer or client for your actions, especially if it causes damage to them. Liability can be of two types ‒ contractual or extra-contractual.

1. Extra-contractual : responsibility that is owed by tort or regulatory damages
2. Contractual: responsibility that is owed within the bounds of an explicit contract

In our description of liability, we are mostly concerned with extra-contractual liability. In the professional context, we are not usually concerned with intentional liability, since we assume that professionals will act in an ethical fashion. However, negligence is another matter. We have already discussed some aspects of professional liability arising from negligent practice in an earlier podcast. We will talk about this in more details in the next podcast also. Here we will discuss the evolution of product liability or the changes in the liability associated with goods that are manufactured for society. Till about two hundred years ago, there was no such thing as product liability. If a buyer bought a product in the market, it was the buyer who took the risk of buying, and therefore had to bear the price of any damage done while using it. There was no compensation that a buyer could expect for damages, caused by a product that they bought. This legal approach is referred to as “caveat emptor” – let the buyer beware. In the last hundred and fifty years, legal systems around the world have moved away from a caveat emptor approach towards an approach that is commonly called “caveat vendidor” – let the seller beware. With the increasing complexity of products, producers, manufacturers, and designers are now held legally responsible for the products they introduce in society. The producer is thus expected to compensate for damages done in the presence of negligent designs or construction. In the general public interest, product liability in many countries have moved in the direction of strict liability. Strict liability is the legal responsibility assigned in the public interest, even in the absence of negligence on the part of the manufacturer. This has created the responsibility for engineers to not just make safe products for the intended user, but also consider its effect on all likely uses and users of products. A good example of strict liability is the message that manufacturers put on plastic bags that the bags could be a choking hazard for children. This message is an effort to reduce the strict liability that courts assign to a product. While strict liability is quite common in U.S., in Canadian courts, strict liability is not widely enforced.

#### Liability in Québec

**Liability**

Liability in Québec is enforced through Québec Civil Code. Like in common law jurisdictions, liability in Quebec is understood as a civil liability. Civil liability refers to the responsibility of the guilty party to pay compensation to the plaintiff for damages or harms caused. There is no punishment in terms of fine or imprisonment that is possible through liability laws in Québec. Under Québec’s liability legislation, compensation in damages is awarded only if three things are established by the plaintiff. First, the plaintiff needs to show that there was an act of omission in the design or construction of the product. An act of omission is taken to mean a defect or a negligent construction in the product. Second, the plaintiff has to demonstrate that a consequence or damage took place. Third and the most vital part is to demonstrate that a cause-effect relation exists between the act of omission and the consequence or damage. In other words, the plaintiff has to demonstrate that as a result of using the product with the defect, the consumer suffered damages. If the court is convinced that all three points have been adequately demonstrated, only then is compensation awarded to the plaintiff.      

 

**Liability Insurance**

Liability insurance is purchased to address business liability risks that are not covered by general liability insurance. Liability insurance is also referred to as “errors and omissions” insurance or “malpractice” insurance. In professional practice, a liability insurance policy pays other parties for damages for which the policy holder is legally liable as a result of negligent acts, errors or omissions in the performance of their professional service. While the insurance pays the compensation to be paid to the plaintiff, it reduces the seriousness that such tort claims can have on the actions of the professional. On the other hand, the insurance is useful, because it protects the firm, the professional, or employees from serious financial disruption. And it provides clients with financial security for the professional services they have received.

In Québec, the professional code requires every order to determine the categories of its members that should secure liability insurance coverage. The OIQ accordingly adopted a regulation requiring professional liability insurance for all members. Thus, every member of the OIQ shall join the group plan insurance contract (with a specified minimum coverage) to address professional liability.

#### Contract and Tort

**Contract**

A contract is a legally 0binding agreement between individuals. Since it is legally binding, if one party to the agreement does not meet their obligations, the other party can approach the courts to redress the situation. A contract can be formally defined as a voluntary agreement made between at least two persons with the mutual intention of creating a legal obligation. When courts examine the validity of contracts, they consider the following elements in deciding on whether the contract is legal or not.

+ First, there has to be a mutual voluntary agreement to enter into the contract. If one party forced another 
party to enter the agreement, that makes the contract void and legally unenforceable.
+ Second, there must be evidence that an offer was made by one party and the other party accepted the offer and then entered into the contract. If the court sees an intent to enter into a contract then that party is thought to have accepted to enter the contract and therefore making it legally binding.
+ Third, a contract should have a motive. In other words, there must be a consideration of benefit for each party to enter into the contract. If it appears that only one party to the contract is giving something while the other party has not given anything, then there is no contract.
+ Fourth, if the contract is made on an illegal matter, then it is unenforceable in a court because the contract is considered illegal. For example, if two people enter into a contract to rob a bank, such a contract cannot be enforced even if one party is not faithful to the contract. 
+ Finally, the parties who enter into the contract have to be legal persons.  

Thus vulnerable people like minors, the mentally incapacitated, or the intoxicated, or aboriginals cannot usually enter into a contract. In addition individuals like public authorities or associations cannot enter into contracts. Such contracts are considered null and void. 


**Contract and Employment**

As professionals, a class of contracts they encounter in the workplace is contracts associated with employment. Depending on their status in an organization, an employee would sign one of the following contracts:

+ Regular employees: an individual who works for an employer and is entitled to wages under an employment contract that controls the details of work performance
+ Contract employees: an individual who has an employment contract for a fixed term
+ Independent contractors: an individual who has a contract for services with the client or customer to undertake a specific project but who is left free to do the assigned work

The following factors help in distinguishing between an employee and a contractor. In the case of an employee, it is the employer who decides the work conditions of an employee, such as when they should come to work. In the case of an employee, it is the employer who owns tools/equipment to accomplish work-related tasks. Finally, it is the employer who benefits from any profits or bears losses from doing a task. In the case of a contractor, in all these factors, the client is not usually concerned with conditions, tools or bearing profits or losses. All these are the responsibility of the contractor.   

 

**Tort**    

The word tort is derived from the French word tort, which means to do wrong. In the legal context, tort refers to the breach of a private obligation to not do wrong to another person. What does private mean in this sentence? It refers to the idea that the damage caused by one person is to another person only and not to society as a whole. More serious actions, such as willful injury or murder, are considered public damage, because they affect society not just the person who was affected. It is for this reason that in criminal cases it is the government that prosecutes the case rather than the victim of the action. A good example of tort would be a person’s private obligation to not make defamatory statements against another person. The person, who makes such statements, may have to face a tort case for their actions. If found guilty in a tort case, the defendant has to pay compensatory damages to the plaintiff. There is no punishment or imprisonment possible within a tort case. There are three types of tort that are recognized in the law – intentional torts, negligence torts, or strict liability torts. Intentional torts as the name suggests occur, when a person acts with the intent of causing harm to another person. Such torts include fraud, trespass, defamation and intimidation, and assault and battery. Negligence torts, as the name suggests, is caused when a person acted negligently to cause harm to another person. Such torts include nuisance, professional negligence, and product liability. It is the last two torts that professionals commonly encounter within their work. It is to avoid these kinds of tort cases that professionals need to pay attention to the work they do. In trying to determine whether a professional was negligent in their actions, courts use a standard known as “duty of care” to evaluate the actions of professionals. The duty of care can be defined as the professional expectation to exercise reasonable care to avoid injuring the plaintiff. A final category of torts is strict liability torts, which do not usually apply in Canada. Here a person can be held responsible for damages caused to another person without any negligence or intention.


### Lesson11

#### Compromise and Conflict Resolution

**Compromise**

In the context of ethical work practice, compromise is a slippery term to define. The slipperiness of the concept arises from the fact that the term can be defined with both positive and negative connotations. The positive connotation for compromise in a conflict situation arises from finding a common ground between differing sides in the spirit of mutual agreement. Another positive connotation associated with the term is that it suggests the quality of flexibility on the part of individuals as they adjust their goals in light of the circumstance. However, at the same time, compromise also possesses some equally striking negative connotations. Compromise suggests a willingness to surrender one’s stated objectives and principles. It also suggests a sign of weakness in conviction. Given these radically differing connotations, the moral status of compromise is always not very clear and requires some clarification. In some conditions making a compromise does not involve ethical issues while in others it does. Under which conditions is making a compromise an ethical issue?

Making a compromise is not an ethical compromise, when individuals agree on fundamental values but disagree on the implementation process. For example, while engineers agree that transparency in job advertisements is necessary but one feels that advertisements should be placed on the internet and the other feels they should be placed in the newspaper. A compromise would mean deciding on an implementation strategy whereby some jobs are advertised in newspapers, while others are put on the internet. Making a compromise is not an ethical compromise when individuals disagree on the relative importance of two different values for example reliability and inexpensiveness. Using the example above, if one engineer feels that job advertisements should be placed on the internet because they are inexpensive, while another suggests that they should be placed in the newspaper because they are reliable, then you attempt to develop a synthetic position that addresses both values. In the example above, a synthetic position would be to arrive at the understanding that it is enough to advertise jobs at universities rather than on the internet or newspapers, because they are both reliable and inexpensive. Making a compromise is an ethical issue, when parties disagree on the same fundamental value. For example, should we compromise on harassment? Making such a compromise usually betrays ones ethical principles and personal integrity. However, even in the case where there is a disagreement on fundamental values, a compromise is acceptable under some specific conditions.

+ If there is a great degree of factual or conceptual uncertainty in making the decision.
+ When the moral issue has great complexity and there is no black/white answer.
+ When there are resource constraints (time limits or physical inabilities) that will lead to an imperfect decision.
+ There is a danger of breaking vital cooperative relationships – team, friends, or family.  

Under these conditions, it may be more appropriate to reach a compromise on a fundamental value conflict.                                 

**Conflict Resolution**

In resolving conflicts, it is not just necessary to examine the ethical aspects of the differences in opinion. It is also necessary to consider the personal and psychological aspects of how individuals deal with differences of opinion. Individuals deal with conflict and disagreement very differently, depending on their workplace personalities. In thinking about how individuals react in conflict situations, it is important to consider two aspects regarding how individuals behave and think. The first aspect is assertiveness or the degree of concern individuals have about the self, and the second aspect is cooperativeness or the degree of concern individuals have about others. The combination of assertiveness or cooperativeness gives individuals their preferred mode of dealing with conflicts. Becoming aware of one’s conflict mode as well as the other person’s allows us to think of a pathway to resolve conflicts. According to these two aspects, people can be categorized into five modes of conflict handling.

1. Competing mode: Individual pursues self-interest at the other person’s expense.
2. Accommodating mode: Individual neglects self-interest to consider the other person’s needs.
3. Avoiding mode: Person avoids conflict situation and does not address it.
4. Collaborating mode: Works with the other person to find a solution that meets the interests of both persons. 
5. Compromising mode: Only partially satisfies both parties.  
According to this logic, compromising is an imperfect solution because it only partially addresses the needs of both parties. However, the important aspect of this five-part categorization is not to say that one mode is always better than the others. Depending on the nature of the conflict, the circumstances, different modes are more appropriate. For example, in an emergency situation where one person has to go to a hospital, one would not attempt a collaborating mode of resolving a conflict of who takes the taxi. In such situations, a competing mode will be the most appropriate. In other situations, like trivial conflicts, it may be the best strategy to avoid the conflict altogether. 

#### Safety, Risk, and the Public

In thinking about public safety and risk in professional practice, a few points need to be born in mind. First, safety (both in terms of workplace safety but also public safety) is a key responsibility engineers need to take very seriously. Second, a way to consider safety is to analyze the nature of risk that the public is exposed to from particular products or processes. We will consider these aspects in more detail below.  


**Safety and Accidents**

Safety is a key responsibility for engineers, both in the workplace as well as for the public. In an earlier lesson, we discussed the legal implications of workplace safety. So we will only consider the implications for public safety here. In thinking about public safety, an engineer needs to bear in mind both product and process safety. Thus, it is not enough to consider how safe products are, but also how safe industrial processes are for the public. Issues of safety are particularly important in the context of accidents. In the industrial environment, accidents can be broadly categorized into three types:

1. Procedural accidents: Such accidents are attributed to operator errors, the failures to follow regulations or standard operating procedures.
  + Solution is to provide better operator training, supervision and regulation.
2. Engineered accidents: Such accidents result from flaws in engineering design or from sub-optimal performance.
  + Solution is to conduct better research and testing of materials and designs.
3. Systemic accidents: These accidents are the ones that are least diagnosable and predictable. These accidents are the result of complexity and coupling between sub-systems that lead to unforeseen accident pathways that can have catastrophic consequences.
  + Solution is to provide multiple redundancies to prevent cascading failures in industrial systems.  

In trying to address these different kinds of accidents, one means engineers have to improve safety is through design. Designing for safety would require engineers to consider the following aspects. First, design must comply with applicable legal standards, in other words, obey legal requirements. Second, design must comply with accepted engineering practice or keep up with the state of the art in knowledge and practices. Third, research all possible alternative designs, including discuss design strategies with other designers. And finally, foresee possible uses and misuses especially in system design, and then create redundancies or backups to address system deficiencies.

 

**Risk and Risk Communication**

Yet another way to address safety is by analyzing and communicating the risk associated with a process or product. But what is risk? Risk can be defined as the probability of an event occurring and of the consequences of that event. Risk, therefore, combines the probability or chance of an event occurring with the consequences of that event. Risk assessment is the process by which the risk associated with a process or product can be characterized. In other words, risk assessment is the determination of quantitative value of risk related to a recognized threat.  There are several existing methods that attempt to model and assess the risk associated with complex processes. Some examples of existing methods include Failure Mode, Effects & Criticality Analysis (FMECA), Hazard Analysis & Critical Control Points, and Failure Tree Analysis. The objective of these methods is usually to identify, model, and evaluate the unique inter-relationship of events leading to failure or unintended events. The end goal of this process being to understand the working of the system better in order to neutralize known sources of risk. Risk neutralization can be defined as the utilization of safety measures to reduce the danger potential of a product or process. It must be born in mind, that while it is possible to reduce risk, it is impossible for a product or process to have zero risk. Zero risk does not exist.                         

Once an engineer has assessed the relevant risk, they need to realize that communicating risks to the public requires a well thought out strategy and it is not sufficient to tell the public about the risk associated. One factor that needs to be considered in all efforts to communicate risk is risk perception. Risk perception can be defined as the degree of sentiment of danger among individuals who are exposed to the source of risk. Given that the perception of risk is a sentiment or feeling, it varies depending upon a host of non-technical factors, such as whether the risk is well known, whether the consequences are short-term or long-term, whether delayed or immediate, whether it is fair or evenly distributed, whether exposure is voluntary or involuntary, or whether there is real possibility of catastrophe. For example, if people believe that they are involuntarily (or not of their choosing) exposed to a risk, they perceive the risk to be higher. Similarly, if the risk is a near-term risk, the public believes it is higher. Again, if there is a possibility, however remote, of a catastrophe associated with the process or product, the perception of risk is always higher.

In this context, the goal of risk communication is to not only inform people and to warn them of potential risks, but also foster trust in the analysis/assessment of risk. With this goal in mind, risk communication requires a well thought out strategy that must have the following elements. Communication must be made by persons in charge and having the authority to share information. All stakeholders affected must be identified and their concerns addressed. Otherwise, it will result in distrust; be honest in assessments but ensure that you do not add to hysteria. Such risk communication is not only important at times of crisis and emergencies, but more importantly to gain voluntary consent of the public before introducing processes or products in society. A good example where voluntary consent is needed to address risk perception would be introducing cutting edge advances in technology, such as nanotechnology devices or genetically modified organisms. Voluntary consent by the public is an essential basis of liberal democracy in a “risk society” – that is a society where products and processes expose citizens to varying levels of risk. Such voluntary consent requires engineers to provide or disclose information and then obtain voluntary agreement from concerned stakeholders for introducing new products or processes.
